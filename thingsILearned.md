You can use const in ES6 javascript to enforce constants
>>> and >> are different, >> ignores sign, >>> does not.
remember ===/== and !==/!= are different because of whether they are strict or looser.
learn how to use it
**= works in javascript.  So do |= ^= &= <<= >>=.
scratch list actually works similar to a linked list.

console.log doesn't work on safari console. The undefined from console.log is because it evals to undefined.
Shift-enter allows multiple lines on the javascript console.
The browser actually compiles javascript.  Javascript is not interpreted. 
Another word for constant is literal value.
