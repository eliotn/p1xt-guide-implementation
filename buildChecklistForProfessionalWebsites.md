##Checklist for projects

###code
1. Include a reset for the css.  normalize.css might be better for more complex projects.  There is also Eric Meyer's Reset.
2. Check html with an html validator http://validator.w3.org - is there an easier way
2. Check css with a css validator https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ - is there an easier way?

###server
1. Include a redirect to a 404 page.

###testing
1. Test on different browsers.  Browserling (https://www.browserling.com) might be a good tool for this.  Or interactive-twitch.
